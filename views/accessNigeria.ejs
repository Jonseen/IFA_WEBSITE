    <p>The Access Nigeria campaign is a PWD led, and targeted campaign that seeks to improve the participation of
        Persons with
        Disabilities (PWDs) in Nigeria’s electoral processes. The campaign seeks to achieve this through evidence-based
        advocacy
        to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), National Assembly, and other public institutions. The
        other
        strategies for achieving the goal of this campaign include PWD-targeted voter education and Get Out the Vote
        (GOTV)
        campaigns to mobilize PWDs to vote during elections.</p>

    <p>So far, the advocacy campaign has been able to influence INEC Nigeria to achieve the following:
    </p>
    <p>
        - Historic deployment of braille ballot guides on a pilot scheme during the September 2018 governorship
        elections in Osun
        state. And full deployment during the 2019 presidential elections. <br><br>
        - Strengthened deployment and utilization of the Magnifying glasses during the elections beginning from the
        Anambra 2017
        elections through the 2019 general elections for Blind voters. <br><br>
        - Historic introduction of the Election Day Written Instructions (Form 30 E PWD) on a pilot scale in the Ekiti
        July 2018
        governorship election, and full deployment during the 2019 general elections for Deaf voters. <br><br>
        - Strengthen observation of the Priority Voting during elections for all PWDs.</p>
    <p>IFA is implementing the Access Nigeria: Disability Votes Matter campaign with technical and financial support
        from the
        National Democratic Institute (NDI), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the British
        Department for International Development (DFID). Components of the Access Nigeria are funded by VOICE Global
        through the
        “Now Us” award winning.</p><br>
    <p>We forge a path to a more inclusive society by investing in individuals, partners, and government
        officials by
        strengthening their capacity to create lasting impact and support a more inclusive society.</p>
    <p></p>
