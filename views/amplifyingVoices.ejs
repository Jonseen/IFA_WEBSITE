    <p>The Inclusive Friends Association (IFA) is a Person with Disability (PWD) woman-led non-profit
        organization that
        promotes the rights of Persons with Disabilities in Africa. Operating extensively throughout Nigeria,
        IFA stands as an
        innovative frontrunner and influential force within the disability community.</p>

    <p>Disability inclusion is at the core of our programming. We employ ART (Advocacy, Research, and Training)
        as a framework
        for our interventions that drive positive change in the lives of PWDs. Through relentless advocacy
        efforts, we are
        creating a lasting impact by influencing national and subnational policies and practices. By engaging
        state and
        non-state actors, we are fostering an inclusive environment that recognizes and respects the rights of
        people with
        Disabilities.</p>
    <p>Research is the cornerstone of our evidence-based approach. We believe in generating concrete data and
        knowledge to
        understand the needs and challenges faced by our communities, which informs our interventions.</p>
    <p>We forge a path to a more inclusive society by investing in individuals, partners, and government
        officials by
        strengthening their capacity to create lasting impact and support a more inclusive society.</p>
